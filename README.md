Unfortunately it took more time because of some issues with Mongodb (locally) and with streams a little bit.
In total, I spent nearly 6 hours on that.

All the scripts from package.json works without any issues.

Couple of @ts-ignore are used in test due to wasted time (it is already took too much time).
ConfigService is not used, so all the ports and other values are default ones.
MailService is not used either.
